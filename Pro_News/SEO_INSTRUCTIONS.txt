OPEN GRAPH and MICRODATA

Pro_News is now capable of creating its own Open Graph entry for FaceBook, and itemtype (Microdata) entries for Google+.

For reasons dictated by FaceBook these entries MUST be placed in the head section of the HTML (between <head ... </head>)
versus the more common body section.  To accomplish this it is neccessary to edit your header.html file by hand to
include the template variables used by Pro_News.

1. At the top of themes/{your_theme}/template/header.html locate the line:

<html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" dir="{S_TEXTDIR}" xml:lang="{S_LANGCODE}" lang="{S_LANGCODE}">

and replace with these 4 lines:

<!-- IF FBOOK_XMLNS -->
	<html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" dir="{S_TEXTDIR}" xml:lang="{S_LANGCODE}" lang="{S_LANGCODE}" itemscope {FBOOK_XMLNS}>
<!-- ELSE -->
	<html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" dir="{S_TEXTDIR}" xml:lang="{S_LANGCODE}" lang="{S_LANGCODE}" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Webpage" >
<!-- ENDIF -->

[ NOTE: If you have already placed FaceBook or Google+ focussed entries of 'itemtype="http://schema.org/Article"',
'xmlns:fb="http://ogp.me/ns/fb#"' or 'xmlns:og="http://opengraphprotocol.org/schema/"' on your current <html>
statement you may need to decide whether you need to keep or replace this. ]

2. Locate the </head> line, then immediately BEFORE it add the lines:

	<!-- IF FBOOK_OG -->
		<meta property="og:image" itemprop="image" content="{BASE_URL}{FBOOK_OG}" />
	<!-- ENDIF -->
	<meta property="og:url" itemprop="url" content="{BASE_URL}{FBOOK_OGURL}" />
	<meta property="og:title" itemprop="name" content="{BASE_URL}{FBOOK_OGTITLE}" />
	<meta property="og:description" itemprop="description" name="description" content="{BASE_URL}{FBOOK_OGDESC}" />
	<meta property="og:author" itemprop="author" content="{BASE_URL}{FBOOK_OGAUTH}" />
	<meta property="og:publisher" itemprop="publisher" content="{BASE_URL}" />

To text the above has been carried out correctly, go to a full article page in Pro_News, ie. a URL of the form:

	http://.........../Pro_News/aid=xxx

The source of the HTML should display:

	An <html> statement which includes the text 'xmlns:fb="http://ogp.me/ns/fb#"'

and

	5 or 6* of the <meta property="og: ... lines with sensible links into your website.

* The <meta property="og:image line will appear if the first Pro_News article image is present.


META DESCRIPTION

Pro_News will amend the existing DragonflyCMS <meta name="description"> line to reflect the
specific article when the full article is displayed.

An Administrator creating, or editing, a Pro_News article can now insert a SEO Description
which will form the basis for the <meta name="description"> line if present.

( If no SEO Description field is present then Pro_News will use up to 255 characters of the
Intro text as it has done in previous releases. )

Either way DragonflyCMS will attempt to preface the Pro_News meta description with your Site's Slogan.
If you want your new SEO Description to appear first in the meta description you will need to instruct
DragonflyCMS not to preface it with the Site Slogan.  To do this open your includes/meta.php file and
find the following line, near the end of the file:

	default:

Immediately BEFORE the default: line insert:

	case 'Pro_News':
		$METATAGS['description'] = '';
		$METATAGS['keywords'] .= '';
	break;

[ NOTE: If you already have an entry for 'Pro_News' you mayt need to revise or mearge the existing lines. ]
