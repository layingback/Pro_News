OPEN GRAPH and MICRODATA

Pro_News is now capable of creating its own Open Graph entry for FaceBook, and itemtype 
(Microdata) entries for Google+.

For reasons dictated by FaceBook these entries MUST be placed in the head section of 
the HTML (between <head ... </head>) versus the more common body section.  To accomplish 
this it is necessary to edit your header.html file by hand to include the template 
variables used by Pro_News.

1. At the top of themes/{your_theme}/template/header.html locate the line:

<html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" dir="{S_TEXTDIR}" xml:lang="{S_LANGCODE}" lang="{S_LANGCODE}">

and replace with these 4 lines:

<!-- IF FBOOK_XMLNS -->
	<html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" dir="{S_TEXTDIR}" xml:lang="{S_LANGCODE}" lang="{S_LANGCODE}" itemscope {FBOOK_XMLNS}>
<!-- ELSE -->
	<html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" dir="{S_TEXTDIR}" xml:lang="{S_LANGCODE}" lang="{S_LANGCODE}" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Webpage" >
<!-- ENDIF -->

[ NOTE: If you have already placed FaceBook or Google+ focused entries of 
'itemtype="http://schema.org/Article"', 'xmlns:fb="http://ogp.me/ns/fb#"' or 
'xmlns:og="http://opengraphprotocol.org/schema/"' on your current <html>
statement you may need to decide whether you need to keep or replace this. ]

2. Locate the </head> line, the following code must be inserted BEFORE this, but with 
some themes placing it just before </head> will result in the OpenGraph/Microdata code 
still appearing in the body of the HTML instead of the head - as required by FaceBook. 
I found that immediately BEFORE the {S_HEADER_TAGS} worked for my theme:

<!-- IF FBOOK_OGURL -->
	<meta property="og:type" content="article" />
	<!-- IF FBOOK_OG --><meta property="og:image" itemprop="image" content="{FBOOK_OG}" /><!-- ENDIF -->
	<meta property="og:url" itemprop="url" content="{FBOOK_OGURL}" />
	<meta property="og:title" itemprop="name" content="{FBOOK_OGTITLE}" />
	<meta property="og:description" itemprop="description" content="{FBOOK_OGDESC}" />
	<meta property="og:site_name" content="{S_SITENAME}" />
	<meta name="twitter:card" content="summary" />
<!-- If you have a facebook presence copy 1 or both of the lines below after adding your fb info
	<meta property="article:publisher" content="https://www.facebook.com/your_fb_sitename" />
	<meta property="article:author" content="https://www.facebook.com/your_fb_profile" />
-->
<!-- ENDIF -->

Obviously drop those last 2 lines, ie. the entire comment, if you do not need them.

Finally, go into Administration > Pro_News > Config and set 'Enable Open Graph' to Yes.

To test the above has been carried out correctly, go to a full article page in Pro_News, 
ie. a URL of the form:

	http://.........../Pro_News/aid=xxx

The source of the HTML should display:

	An <html> statement which includes the text 'xmlns:fb="http://ogp.me/ns/fb#"'

and

	6 or 7* of the <meta property="og: ... lines with sensible links into your website 
should appear BEFORE the </head> line.

* The <meta property="og:image ... line will appear only if the first Pro_News article image 
is present.


META DESCRIPTION

Pro_News will amend the existing DragonflyCMS <meta name="description"> line to reflect the
specific article when the full article is displayed.

An Administrator creating, or editing, a Pro_News article can now insert an SEO Description
which will form the basis for the <meta name="description"> line if present.

( If no SEO Description field is present then Pro_News will use up to 255 characters of the
Intro text as it has done in previous releases. )

NOTE: The above applies when Pro_News is displaying a Full Article.  For all other Pro_News 
pages, the existing settings in includes/meta.php will be utilised.
