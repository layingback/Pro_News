THIS TEXT IS NOW OUT-OF-DATE in that Social Networking Links are largely built into the product as of v3.2.
Executed version of Social Network html is held in /themes/{your theme}/template/pronews/soc_net.html

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Starting with version 2.2.0.0 Pro_News has a hook included with the Full Article display 
to enable the optional use of Digg It! and similar posts.

I have drawn up a sample piece of HTML which I think will allow linking into many of these sites. 
However, as I don't use them, I've not tested them, and I have no intention of supporting them. 
But if anyone wants to include this code in one of the templates, I'd be interested in seeing
and hearing of the results.

Take the HTML code in the attached sample_soc_net.html file, and insert it in an article template 
under the newsarticle section.  Look in indexabl2.html for a suggested location for this code
(do a Find on Social Network links).

This sample code includes ask, bebo, blinklist, bloglines, blogmarks, blogoshpere, comments, delicious, 
digg, diigo, facebook, fark, friendfeed, furl, google, kirtsy, linkedin, magnolia, mister-wong, mixx, 
muti, myspace, netvouz, newsvine, propeller, reddit, simpy, slashdot, sphere, sphinn, spurl, squidoo, 
stumble, tagza, tailrank, technorati, tumblr, twitter, wikio, wink, yahoo and yahoobuzz. 42! 

I doubt anyone wants that many, but it's a lot easier for you to delete unwanted ones 
than add new ones! It should also not be hard to add additional ones, as they mostly fall into 1 
of about 3 styles of call. To add new icons, place 16 x 16px images in the same folders as the 
others - and please consider posting the how-to at http://layingback.net for the benefit of others.
