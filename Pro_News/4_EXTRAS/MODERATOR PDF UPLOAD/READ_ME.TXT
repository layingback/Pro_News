As of v3.4.8 Pro_News can support the PDF Upload as a Moderator function.

This means that members of the selected Moderator Groups (including Administrators) 
can execute a PDF upload without needing to log in as an Admin.

Efforts have been made to make this action as secure as possible, which is why 
this function is limited to Moderators.  But having any upload available does 
increase the risk.  So on initial installation this function is effectively 
disabled due to the missing template.

IMPORTANT
To enable PDF Upload for Moderators you must copy the pdfl.html template from this 
folder to themes/default/template/pronews/ or themes/{your_theme}/template/pronews/ 
or both.
