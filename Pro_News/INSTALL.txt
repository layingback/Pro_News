INSTALL Instructions.

	etc. ...
Example:
	Local Directory: 	Pro News\modules\Pro_News
	Website Directory: 	public_html/modules/Pro_News

The theme related files can go in the "default" theme directory,
but must also be copied to your current theme or themes.  So,
the entire contents of:
	Pro News\themes\default\*.*
needs to be copied into:
	Pro News/themes/{your_theme_name}/*.*

On some systems it may be necesary to chmod uploads/pro_news/,
	see uploads/pro_news/info.txt for details.

2.  Goto Admin -> Modules
	 Find the Pro News module and click 'Install'

3.  Review settings in Admin -> Pro_News -> Config
	 Before going further ensure that you have at least 1 Forum created suitable for Pro_News Discussions.

4.  Under the 'Section' tab, add at least 1 new Section which is set to be Publicly viewable.

5.  Under the 'Category' tab, add at least 1 new Category and make sure it is assigned to your new Section.

7.  Go to Admin -> General -> CPG Main Menu and click the button to add a new item,
	 set Title to Article Search, URL to Pro_News&amp;mode=srch and select getlink, Category to Search.

8.  If this is a NEW install ONLY rename the file called NEW INSTALL ONLY - RENAME ME TO pn_specific.css in
     themes/{your_theme or default}/style/ to pn_specific.css
     ( Do NOT rename the file if this is an update or you will overwrite your edits in pn_specific.css )

{OPTIONAL - May be better done later.}
	9.  Under the Admin -> Pro_News -> Block tab, create a block to refer to your new Section.

NOTE:
  On some systems it may be necessary change the permissions in the upload/ directory, see the
  instructions in the info.txt file: "chmod this directory 755 (777 on some systems) to allow image uploads"


!!! SPECIAL WARNING !!!
Do NOT install any Pro_News blocks through Admin > Blocks.  Instead go to Admin > Pro_News > Blocks and
let Pro_News customize and install your blocks for you.


PLEASE READ CHANGES.txt for detailed information about Pro_News usage and operation.


SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS FOR 9.0.6.1

Dragonfly 9.0.6.1 does not support a default theme, therefore theme files need to be installed into your current theme
directory or directories, and copied to any additional themes that you wish to use.
Dragonfly 9.0.6.1 does not include pagination support, so the following manual step is required:
 - copy pagination.php into /modules/Pro_News/includes/
Your Dragonfly 9.0.6.1 theme needs to support pagination, or you need to copy it from Dragonfly theme style.css.
Many Dragonfly 9.0.6.1 themes do not support the display of Center Blocks, and therefore cannot display
Pro_News Center Block.

ENJOY!

That should be it.
Any questions, comments, bug reports, feature requests, complaints, etc., etc.,
should be posted in the forums on www.layingback.net under the proper sections -
NOT on the DragonflyCMS.org forums, please.  Also please set your www/Web Site under Your Profile
if you want me to visit your site.

TROUBLESHOOTING

Please check www.layingback.net > Support Forums for latest info, but ...
If the first time you go into Administration > Pro_News and you see nothing beyond 4 lines of Article/Category/Section
counts, i.e. no links, nothing to click on, then try deleting /cache/config_MAIN_CFG.php on your server so that DF can
retry reading your newest Pro_News Configuration values from your db.
